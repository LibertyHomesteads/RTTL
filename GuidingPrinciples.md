## RTTL: Community vision 
We seek to create a decentralized movement, formed of various individuals and societies returning to the land. We will promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our values. We will facilitate economic and social harmony between all groups and individuals in our movement. 

## RTTL: Community Mission 
We will return to the land to separate ourselves from a corrupted modern society, and will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.

## RTTL: Community Goals 
1. To facilitate individuals and groups that share common ancestry to purchase land in rural areas
2. To facilitate media activities to promote our movement 
3. To create many independent and fully-functioning parallel societies
4. To teach, share, and develop successful methods of garnering independence and building community 
5. To cultivate wholesomeness, beauty, health, and hope in a trying world

## RTTL: Guidelines for Communities
*This section was written using notes from the Asha Logos video "A Call to Return to the Land," with input from RTTL members.*  

### Primary goals of an RTTL Community
* Return to the land, return to hard assets
* Simplicity (A Call to Return to the Land 25:00)  
     * **Food and water:** Closer to the source, with less treatment/processing and no artificial additives
     * **Homes and construction:** Less synthetic, more natural materials, can be built by the community
     * **Ultimate goal:** To produce a large part of our consumables within the community or by trading with neighbors
     * **Governance:** *"Govern wisely and as little as possible!"* â€“ Sam Houston
* Economic system framework
     * Focus on barter and/or alternative currencies such as gold and silver
     * Parallel institutions
     * Direct exchange within community
     * Establish trading relationships with nearby communities
     * Community centers as trading hubs 
* Embrace creation and construction, eliminate parasitism
     * Everyone should teach, learn, and/or do
     * Apprenticeship model may be central
* Encourage and support a strong family unit (A Call to Return to the Land 26:50)
     * Foundational of the larger community
     * Ease the burden of parents with community programs like sports and clubs
* Intentional direction of societal structures away from profit and toward health
     * Community organized sports and gyms
     * Fostering friendships and relationships
     * Educational opportunities, churches, other religious/spiritual organizations
* Clear and proactive purpose (30:30)
     * Not just an escape for a small group
     * To help all good, genuine, likeminded individuals
* Encourage beauty in all actions
   
### Practical Issues  
  
* Raise funds to purchase land and build infrastructure
     * Determine legal structure and framework
     * Write organizational documents for each community (RTTL can provide templates) 
     * Use generally accepted accounting principles for transparency
     * Avoid one "trusted individual" handling large amounts of funds on behalf of the group, whether as cash or in personal accounts 
* Find people/families to purchase and live on that land
    * Varying schemes such as ownership, lease, rent, sweat equity, etc
* Attract and consult experts in restoring land and fixing degenerated ecosystems
* Build clubs of like-minded people around a common interest
* Meta mission/feeding factors:
     * Most or all members generally need to know what others are doing that supports the community
     * Do not devolve into just farming, community involvement and development is essential
* Ideology:  
    * Must resist cults of personality
    * Ideology must be flexible within culture and rigid outside
    * No purity spiraling 
    * No concern trolling 

  
### Selected desired outcomes
* Facilitate isolation from disruptive and destructive politics
* Facilitate isolation from perverse mainstream media / social media
* Facilitate meeting and social interaction leading to happy, stable marital relationships
* Encourage well-rounded education including "hidden history," both ancient and recent
* Encourage an independent mindset, self-actualized agency harnessed to productive participation
* General goal of returning to and reclaiming the land (in a sense of restoring functionality, recovering ownership, building community)
  
    
### Likely problems
* Taxes, IRS expects money for barter (RTTL should provide resources and guidelines) 
* Permits, regulations, zoning laws (RTTL should provide resources and guidelines) 
* Could devolve into communism
* Community needs strong leaders to keep out leeches
* Strong leaders can devolve to fascism and personality cults
* Community needs to be able to kick out problematic members who will not reform, without draining the social atmosphere causing good people to leave 
* Very low tolerance for disruptive individuals
