## RTTL: Community vision 
We seek to create a decentralized movement, formed of various individuals and societies returning to the land. We will promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our values. We will facilitate economic and social harmony between all groups and individuals in our movement. 

## RTTL: Community Mission 
We will return to the land to separate ourselves from a corrupted modern society, and will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.

## RTTL: Community Goals 
1. To facilitate individuals and groups that share common ancestry to purchase land in rural areas
2. To facilitate media activities to promote our movement 
3. To create many independent and fully-functioning parallel societies
4. To teach, share, and develop successful methods of garnering independence and building community 
5. To cultivate wholesomeness, beauty, and hope in a trying world

○ Strong leaders can devolve to fascism and personality cults
• Where do you get fuel for farming?
