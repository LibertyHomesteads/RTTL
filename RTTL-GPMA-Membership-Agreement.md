# Copypasta'd from Liberty Dollar 

I hereby apply for Membership in Liberty Dollar Financial Association (hereinafter known as LDFA), a Private Membership Association. With the signing of this agreement I accept the offer made to become a Member and I express my agreement with the following Declaration and Memorandum of Understanding:

DECLARATION

    This Association of Members hereby declare that our primary purpose is to protect and maintain our right to freedom of choice regarding the conduct of business and management of our financial assets by asserting our constitutional, contractual, and civil rights under God, the Common Law and the Constitution of the United States of America.

    As Members, we affirm our belief that the Constitution of the United States guarantees all Americans, particularly Members of Private Membership Associations, the right of freedom of association, speech, contract, assembly, belief, and associated activities, and that these are among our inalienable rights.

    We declare and assert the right to select those whom we believe can be expected to give the wisest counsel and advice regarding those matters which form the basis of this Association and to authorize those Members who are most skilled to facilitate the actual performance and delivery of such relevant skills and services as they and we deem appropriate. We assert these rights under the Federal and State Constitutions, Federal and State law, the Common Law and the statutes and regulations interpreting them.

    We claim our freedom to choose and accept for ourselves the types of tools and services provided by LDFA that we think might best benefit us in the pursuance of our goals. We do this in order that we might achieve specific outcomes which do not in any way impinge upon the rights, safety or well-being of the Public. We reserve the right to include traditional, non-traditional or even unconventional options as our Member Facilitators choose to deliver, subject always to our own individual acceptance and approval.

    More specifically, our mission is to provide Members with the highest quality guidance, advice and tools to achieve such goals. We strive to stay on the leading edge of new and better methods, techniques and materiel.

    This Association recognizes all Members, without respect to race, creed, philosophy or religion, who are in accordance with our principles and policies. Membership shall endure for the lifetime of this Association.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

I understand that those Members of LDFA that provide services or advice do so in the capacity of fellow Member Facilitators in a private manner and not in any public capacity. I understand that within LDFA, no Public Doctor-Patient or Public Provider-Client relationships exist. Within LDFA, I freely choose to change my legal status from that of a Public Person to that of a Private Membership Association individual. I realize that in doing so I relinquish certain Federal and State protections and privileges, and I do so with full knowledge and consent thereof.

I understand that it is my personal responsibility to evaluate the services offered and to educate myself as to the efficacy, risks, or desirability. I agree that the actions I take in this regard are of my own free will. If I am accepted for Membership, I will exercise my rights for my own benefit and agree to hold harmless LDFA and Member Facilitators from any unintentional liability that might result from the advice or services I receive, except from any harm that could remotely result from an instance of deliberate fraud or “a clear and present danger of substantive evil” as determined by LDFA and defined by the United States Supreme Court.

I understand and accept that, since LDFA is protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, it is exempt from any action of Federal, State or Local agencies entrusted to “protect the public” as it relates to any complaints or grievances against LDFA, its physical premises or equipment, its Trustees, Member Facilitators or other associated staff or consultants. All complaints or grievances will be settled by non-judicial arbitration within LDFA. Also, those Membership and private Member records kept by LDFA are strictly protected and can only be released upon written request of the subject Member.

I agree that I am joining this private Membership Association under the United States Constitution and the Common Law as recognized within the United States of America. I understand that Members seek to help each other achieve and sustain financial management and stability. I understand and accept that the facilitators and other providers, who are fellow Members, offer advice, services, and benefits that are not necessarily conventional or traditional.

As a Member, my goal is to accept those services and material that I feel will truly help me to achieve my relevant goals. I will choose those which, after careful deliberation and advice, I consider proper and which provide me a reasonable chance to achieve those goals. I realize that no advice or services are foolproof. For example, if I choose to forgo procedures or actions that have been recommended by others in the public sector, I accept any resulting risk. I assert my right of informed consent.

My activities within LDFA are a private matter and I decline to share them with any Federal or State regulatory enforcement agency, including any medical board, FDA, Medicare or Medicaid, financial regulators or any other similar agency. Any records that I have shared with other Members remain the property of LDFA.

I, in becoming a Member, agree not to file malpractice, civil or criminal lawsuits against a fellow Member, unless by willful action or inaction that Member exposes me to a clear and present danger of substantive evil. I further agree that all Association Members are exempt from the provisions of any state business regulation, medical practices regulation or any similar federal, state or local legislation.

I enter into this agreement of my own free will, or on behalf of a designated dependent, without any pressure or promise of benefit. I affirm that I do not represent any state or federal agency whose purpose is to regulate or limit the practice of any professional service of any kind. I accept that this Membership does not entitle me to any voting interest in LDFA. I acknowledge I am not liable for any debts, liabilities, suits or judgments against LDFA. I understand that this Membership does not absolve me from any personal obligation outside of this Association.

I have read and understand this contract and any questions I had were answered fully to my satisfaction. This document consists of my entire agreement for Membership and it supersedes any previous agreement I may have made, either express or implied.

I understand that my Membership fee, if any, entitles me to receive those benefits declared by a Trustee to be general benefits, and that any further charges have been explained to me. I also agree to pay, as levied, for those benefits that I request and receive that are declared to be special assessments, as per a posted fee schedule.

The term of the Membership begins on the date upon which I create my Membership and continues until the dissolution of this Association. By creating my Membership and Account on the LDFA Website, I do certify, attest and warrant that I have carefully read this application for Membership and I fully understand and agree with all the provisions stated herein.

The Waldo Way, PMA
A Private Membership Association
Membership Contract
“One Family, One Farm, One Dream”
 

I/We, __________________________________, for membership fee paid in hand, do hereby apply for membership in The Waldo Way, PMA, a fraternal organization. With the signing of this membership, I/we accept the offer made to become a member of The Waldo Way, PMA and have read and agree with the following Declaration of Purpose from Article I of Waldo Way, PMA’s Articles of Association:

This Association of members hereby declares that our main objective is to maintain and improve the civil rights, constitutional guarantees, and political freedom for every member and citizen of the United States of America. We believe and affirm that the Constitution of the United States is one of the best documents ever created by man, and the signers of the Declaration of Independence did so out of love for their country.

We believe that God and the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees our members free speech, petition, assembly, right to contract, and the right to gather together for the lawful purpose of advising and helping one another in assertion of our rights under the Federal and State Constitutions and Statutes. We strive to maintain and improve the civil rights, constitutional guarantees, freedom of choice in education, healthcare, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and a variety of quality foods.

It is hereby declared that we are exercising our right, our “freedom of association” as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and equivalent provisions of the various state constitutions. This means that our Association activities are restricted to the private domain only.

We declare the basic right of all of our members to select spokespersons from our number who could be expected to give wisest counsel and advice concerning the need for high quality production of food, cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and to select from our number those members who are the most skilled to assist and facilitate the actual performance and delivery of services and products. In addition, we proclaim the freedom to choose and perform for ourselves the types of foods, services and products that we think best for achieving and maintaining optimal wellness. Further, we proclaim and reserve the right to include health options that include, but are not limited to, cutting edge modalities, products and therapies.

Mission: The Waldo Way, PMA strives for greater availability of products and services and to provide education to its members.

Our association understands that health and wellness has many dimensions and strives everyday to provide quality food products, complementary and alternative therapies including the rights of Christian beliefs. The Waldo Way, PMA also provides its members with workshops, special events, tours, consultations, cooking classes, health coaching, and other training toward the advancement of wholistic (mind, body, spirit) wellness. A symbiotic relationship exists between the services and the products that are offered by the Association.

I have freely chosen to change my legal status from a public consumer to a private member of the Association. Therefore, I accept all personal responsibilities for my own actions of consuming and/or participating in the Association, releasing the Association of all liability for doing so. I agree to hold the Trustee’s, staff, other work members and the Association harmless from any unintentional liabilities for the results of their actions, except for harm that results from instances of a clear and present danger of substantive evil as determined by the Association, as stated and defined by the United States Supreme Court.

The Trustees and members have chosen NaRisa Y. Waldo and Trenton A. Montgomery as the persons best qualified to provide services to the members of the Association and entrust them to select other qualified members to assist them in carrying out particular services for its members.

I understand that the Association is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it is outside the jurisdiction and authority of Federal and State Agencies and Authorities concerning any and all  complaints or grievances against the Association, any Trustee(s), members or other staff persons. All rights of complaints and grievances will be waived by the member for the benefit of the Association and its members. I fully  understand that I am consuming “raw” food products. The member waives HIPAA privacy rights and complaint processes.

As a Waldo Way, PMA member, I understand that the PMA has a Member Cost Sharing Policy, and that if I am to receive products from the PMA’s livestock, then I am obligated to remit to the PMA at the time of receipt my Cost Share for such product. I also understand that the Trustees may from time to time assess a transaction fee or an annual or periodic membership fee; additional assessments may be made at any time for services or benefits rendered.  Honorary memberships may be offered and recognized. Additionally, The Board of Trustees reserves the right to waive dues for guests of Trustees and/or its members.

I agree to join the Association, a Private Membership Association under common law, whose members seek to help each other achieve better health through spiritual, mental and physical well-being.
